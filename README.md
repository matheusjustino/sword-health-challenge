# **SWORD HEALTH CHALLENGE**

## Instructions

- This repository contains all the necessary and ready-to-use code. It's only necessary to enter each k8s directory and run the command `kubectl apply -f .` to start each pod. The api's docker images are available on my [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repositories).
- When starting the application, two users will be automatically generated for testing. Your credentials can be found in the `DatabaseSeeder` file within the `database module`.
- Also, I'm making json available to be imported into your postman and make it easier to use.
- You'll can check the notifications (when some tech perform a task) on notifications-app logs.
